# Probability and Statistics

**Why is it important?**
Probability and statistics are the backbone of decision-making in trading. These concepts help analyze market behavior, assess risks, and evaluate the statistical significance of trading strategies.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand probability distributions and their applications in trading.
- Conduct hypothesis testing to validate trading strategies.
- Implement Monte Carlo simulations for risk analysis.

---

## Topics Covered
1. **Probability Distributions**:
   - Normal, Binomial, and Poisson distributions
   - Applications in market modeling

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Null and alternative hypotheses
   - t-tests and p-values in strategy validation

3. **Monte Carlo Simulations**:
   - Generate random outcomes for risk modeling
   - Simulate price paths for portfolio evaluation
